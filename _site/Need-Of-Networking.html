<p>Before stepping into the technical details of Computer Networks, Every beginner must determine why people have an interest in it and what makes it necessary for the survival of any organization in this competitive era.Today we are going to learn about Network Goals , Advantages and Disadvantages of Network and also Application of Networks . So let’s dive in.</p>

<h3 id="network-goals--">Network Goals -</h3>

<p>We know that a lot of organizations already have a substantial amount of computers, often located far apart. So it is important to understand network goals and implement them for your organization. So in a nut shell we will refer it as the following :</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Resource Sharing</strong> - The goal here is to make all programs, data and peripherals accessible to anyone on the network regardless of the physical location of the resources and the user.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reliability</strong> - A file can have copies on two or three various machines, so if one of them is unavailable, the other copies could be used. For Banking, air reservation, Military and lots of other applications it is of great value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cost factor</strong> - Personal computers have greater (price/performance) ratio than micro computers. So it’s better to keep PC’s, one per user, with data stored on one shared file server machine; rather than having many micro computers , which will only increase the cost to the company .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Communication medium</strong> - While using a network, it is possible for managers, working far apart, to develop the financial report of the company. The changes at one end can be instantly noticed at another and hence it accelerates the co-operation among them.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="advantages-of-networks--">Advantages of Networks -</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Share Resources</strong> - We can share resources such as printers and scanners. This costs less than buying equipment for each computer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Can Share Software</strong> - Software is often installed centrally instead of on each machine. Metering software can then be used to limit the numbers of copies being run at only one time. This is less expensive than buying licenses for each and every machine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Share Storage</strong> - We can access files from any machines on the network which allows us to share data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Improve Communications</strong> - We Can send messages via network . For Example :-Internal Mail.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="disadvantages-of-networks--">Disadvantages of Networks -</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The systems are very complex to run or we can say that they are very sophisticated .This can add to costs and you may need staff of specialists to run the network.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If software and files are centrally held, it is going to be impossible to do any work if the central server fails . People become more reliant on the communications, if these fails it can cause chaos.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If networks are badly managed then services can become unusable and productivity will fall.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>File security is also important especially if connected to WANs e.g. Protection from viruses.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="applications-of-networks">Applications of Networks</h3>

<p>Computer Networks have made a major impact on the society as a whole but it will be too long to discuss all of them here , so we will only discuss the ones which I thought are Important ones.</p>

<h4 id="sharing">Sharing</h4>

<p>The potential advantage of a network is to supply a simple and versatile means of sharing. There are three distinct types of sharing :</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Peripherals</strong> - These are often expensive. It is impractical for all computers on the network to keep both its laser printer (for quality printing) and dot-matrix printer (for general printouts). A main frame may have one among them connected to it allowing all users controlled access in a cost effective manner.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A user with a multi-user system can share and swap information in a number of ways . Examples are - Sending electronic mail or having controlled access to some files or database.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Talking about a traditional time sharing system, all the control is performed centrally in it; if the processor fails then the entire system fails . In a network system, this will not be the case.If one node fails then it should not have a ‘domain’ effect on rest. This is called distributed control and it is a burning and live area of research at present.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="access-to-remote-database">Access to remote database</h4>

<p>Another large area of network use is access to remote databases. It is simple for the typical person sitting at his PC to make reservations for airplanes, trains, hotels and so on, anywhere in the world with instantaneous and fast confirmation.</p>

<h4 id="communication-facilities">Communication facilities</h4>

<p>A third category of possible widespread network use is as a communication medium. Possibly everyone can send and receive electronic mail, not just people in the computer business, to send and receive electronic mail. Additionally this mail is ready to contain digitized voice,, still pictures and even moving television and video images.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion--">Conclusion -</h3>

<p>To conclude, Using computer network as a sophisticated communication system will reduce the amount of traveling done, thus saving energy. The information revolution is expected to change society as much as the Industrial Revolution did.</p>

<p>That was all for now. Will be back soon with some more interesting articles. Till then -</p>
