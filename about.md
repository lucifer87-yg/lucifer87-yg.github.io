## Hi there!

![](/assets/about3.png)

My name is **Yash Gorasiya**.

I am a 3rd year bachelors student pursuing degree in **CSE** with specialisation in **Cyber Security** and **Digital Forensics** at **VIT Bhopal University**.

I am the founder of **Cyversity** which aims at bringing up the like minded people to learn and explore the world of `cyber security`. I am also the founding member of first ever student chapter of Null community, **Null VIT Bhopal Student Chapter**. 

I am an aspiring Security Analyst with much of an interest in `Digital Forensics` and `Cyber Investigations`. I completed my Summer Internship as **Cyber Forensics Intern** with **Directorate of Forensics Science - Gandhinagar** where I got a golden opportunity to get hands-on experience for several highly demanded tools in `Digital Forensics` field, this includes `Cellebrite UFED`, `Cellebrite Physical Analyser`, `XRY Forensics`, `OS Forensics`, `FTK Imager` etc. I was also member of recently concluded **Gurugram Police Cyber Security summer Intenship** which was in online mode.

In the free time I do reasearch about `forensic case studies` , write stuffs related to `Cyber Security` and `Forensics` mainly `Digital Forensics` and `Forensic Biology`. Apart from these I love to interact with people from different domains, learning new things from them and taking their suggestions in order to achieve my vision of learning new things everyday.

I firmly believe the concepts of "**_Giving back to the community_**".
